## Background
* See: [Working Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-HPog_7pPUXrECzne1t6X7eKwo8TzpYBZ8iC8FfASoE/edit?usp=sharing)

* In early 2017, the Creative Commons Global Network (CCGN) completed a consultation process of renewing and reorganizing itself to support a strong and growing global movement. The year-long process resulted in the [CCGN Global Network Strategy](https://creativecommons.org/about/global-affiliate-network/network-strategy/).
Part of the new strategy is to establish defined areas of focus, or “platforms,” which will drive CC’s global activities. This document is a set of draft ideas to launch a CC Global Network Open Education Platform.

## Goals and Objectives 

* See: [Working document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-HPog_7pPUXrECzne1t6X7eKwo8TzpYBZ8iC8FfASoE/edit?usp=sharing)

* Platform members are currently dicussing Goals. Draft ideas to date:
	* Increase education equity by reducing barriers to education, including access, cost, language, cultural context, and technical format.
	* Ensure educators have the legal rights to retain, reuse, revise, remix and redistribute educational resources as they determine – without having to ask permission.
	* Increase the efficiency and effectiveness of public funds spent on education.
	* Connect communities of educators and learners around OER and OEP.
	* Demonstrate the pedagogic value of digital, internet and alternative low-bandwidth technologies to further open education.
	* Identify research needed for OER, OEP and open education licensing policies, and work with global research teams to close the gaps.
	* Increase the amount of OER available in languages less represented on the internet than English
	* Empower “disfavored regions” to develop contextually appropriate open policies and to enhance/increase the presence of Open content representing their region.
	* Ensure educators have the legal rights and working knowledge of open licenses in order to exercise 5 Rs permissions to localize OER.
