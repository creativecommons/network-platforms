## Background

This document is intended to provide the rationale for a platform through which the Creative Commons Global Network (CCGN) and GLAM organisations can engage in activities related to releasing their content. 

The support for an Open GLAM platform was initially discussed at the 2017 CC Global Summit session “A GLAM platform in the new global network structure”, and has been progressed in a number of calls with interested partners and organizations. 

## Goals and Objectives 

The Open GLAM platform is an area of work or activity to:
- Share resources and enhance collaboration between different actors working on the GLAM sector to release and free, to the extent possible, their digital collections;
- Progres the discussion of policy positions over how the GLAM sector can be more effective on releasing content and defending the public domain, the right to remix and reuse cultural works and the right to freely interpret cultural history by enhancing full access to cultural works.
